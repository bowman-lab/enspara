Structure naming convention:
First three alphanumeric indicates dye (e.g. Alexa) and optimal wavelength (e.g. 48 = 488)

Tailing alpha numeric indicates linker type.
C = maleimide chemistry with cysteine base residue
B = hydroxylamine chemistry with p-acetyl-l-phenylalanine base residue
L = NHS ester chemistry with lysine base residue.

Tailing letter (C, R, N) indicates residue type
C - c-terminus
R - interior peptide
N - n-terminal peptide
