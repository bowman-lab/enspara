    -----
    This function implements the NMI-APC metric proposed by Lopez et al
    for assessing sequence covariation. The equation is a combination of
    normalized mutual entropy (NMI) and average product correlation
    (APC), both of which are used for sequence covariation. The equation
    for NMI-APC is

    NMI-APC(M_i, M_j) = I(M_i, M_j) - APC(M_i, M_j) / H(M_i, M_j)

    where I is the mutual information and H is the shannon entropy of
    the joint distributions of random variables/distributions M_i and
    M_j. Supplimentary Note 1 in ref [1] is an excellent summary of this
    approach.
