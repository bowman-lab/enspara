Functions for enumerating paths through an MSM for a given
set of sink and source states.

These are the canonical references for TPT. Note that TPT
is really a specialization of ideas very familiar to the
mathematical study of Markov chains, and there are many
books, manuscripts in the mathematical literature that
cover the same concepts.

In addition, the original paper from Dijkstra describing the
path finding algorithm we employ is listed below.

    Get the top N paths by iteratively performing Dijkstra's

    Parameters
    ----------
    sources : array_like, int
        One-dimensional list of nodes to define the source states.
    sinks : array_like, int
        One-dimensional list of nodes to define the sink states.
    net_flux : np.ndarray
        Net flux of the MSM
    remove_path : str or callable, optional
        Function for removing a path from the net flux matrix.
        (if str, one of {'subtract', 'bottleneck'})
        See note below for more details.
    num_paths : int, optional
        Number of paths to find
    flux_cutoff : float, optional
        Quit looking for paths once the explained flux is greater
        than this cutoff (as a percentage of the total).

    Returns
    -------
    paths : list
        List of paths. Each item is an array of nodes visited
        in the path.
    fluxes : np.ndarray, shape = [n_paths,]
        Flux of each path returned.

    Notes
    -----
    The Dijkstra algorithm only allows for computing the
    *single* top flux pathway through the net flux matrix. If
    we want many paths, there are many ways of finding the
    *second* highest flux pathway.

    The algorithm proceeds as follows:

    1. Using the Djikstra algorithm, find the highest flux
       pathway from the sources to the sink states
    2. Remove that pathway from the net flux matrix by
       some criterion
    3. Repeat (1) with the modified net flux matrix

    Currently, there are two schemes for step (2):

    - 'subtract' : Remove the path by subtracting the flux
      of the path from every edge in the path. This was
      suggested by Metzner, Schutte, and Vanden-Eijnden.
      Transition Path Theory for Markov Jump Processes.
      Multiscale Model. Simul. 7, 1192-1219 (2009).
    - 'bottleneck' : Remove the path by only removing
      the edge that corresponds to the bottleneck of the
      path.

    If a new scheme is desired, the user may pass a function
    that takes the net_flux and the path to remove and returns
    the new net flux matrix.

    msmbuilder.tpt.top_path : function for computing the single
        highest flux pathway through a network.
